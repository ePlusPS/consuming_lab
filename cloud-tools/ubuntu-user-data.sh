# To use an OpenStack cloud you need to authenticate against the Identity
# service named keystone, which returns a **Token** and **Service Catalog**.
# The catalog contains the endpoints for all services the user/tenant has
# access to - such as Compute, Image Service, Identity, Object Storage, Block
# Storage, and Networking (code-named nova, glance, keystone, swift,
# cinder, and neutron).
#
# *NOTE*: Using the 2.0 *Identity API* does not necessarily mean any other
# OpenStack API is version 2.0. For example, your cloud provider may implement
# Image API v1.1, Block Storage API v2, and Compute API v2.0. OS_AUTH_URL is
# only for the Identity API served through keystone.

Now you can source the openrc.sh script as in:

  source ~/openrc.sh

At the begining of your sessions, and the system will prompt you for your password.

You can then run commands like:

  nova list
