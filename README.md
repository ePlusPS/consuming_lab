Lab material for Consuming Cloud
================================

Most of the class material has moved to:

  http://onecloudclass.com

The cloud-tools directory, however, includes
some user-data scripts and heat templates that
are intended to simplify the startup of a 
"bastion" host that has all of the openstack
command line tools available.
